I graduated from university with a degree in architecture. When the recession was at its low point in 2010, the building industry was looking pretty grim and it was difficult to land a new grad job. On the bright side, it gave me a chance to explore other fields of work for self-growth before returning to the realm of architecture. Then for six years, I practiced architecture at design and construction firms based in New York City. 

Over the years, I had dabbled in various online coding resources, attended meetups and even a hackathon in another city (where I spent more time observing and learning alongside others). Michael Hartl's online tutorials -  [Learn Enough to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/) were one of the free online code resources that really made me start learning how to learn, and got me excited. I had also done some of Flatiron school's pre-bootcamp prep-work as well as some other bootcamp preps. 

Within this time, I met my better half in New York City and had gotten married. We both share a passion for exploring the outdoors and rock climbing.  Each time we traveled, we made friends with locals. These chance encounters around the world gave me the opportunity to learn a little bit about each unique individual, share similar passions and become part of an ever-growing open-source community. There are many free community resources online, and I noticed right away that in person, everyone is willing to collectively share what methods they used to successfully get up the outdoor climbs, and in some cases, the grading difficulty of a climb is open to discussion. The climbing community is about creating something to share and better each other with, it's also a way of protecting the areas that are enjoyed by many.

This changed my perspective on life again. I felt like I was building towards a direction that was dishonest. I felt the tug of imposter syndrome.  I craved to be challenged creatively within the support of a community. Feeling this stagnancy within myself, I knew I had to face some tough questions. What else did I want to explore and how did I want to expand my skillset? I also had to admit to myself that even though I liked architecture, I wasn't really as involved in updating my technology skills since most of the deadline driven projects would mean getting pigeon-holed into doing repetitive tasks.  I needed a change to my schedule that wasn't possible in the building industry and its work culture environment. 

What I was willing to do was explore and expand my skillset in the programming realm. My friends and mentors that transitioned into programming jobs from other job sectors encouraged me to stay curious and basically just to keep on doing it. And that is exactly what I did - I stayed involved and utilized the free code resources during evenings and weekends. 

One thing I can stand by is that I feel passionate learning how to learn. Learning how to program has become a bit  obsessive where the more it breaks, the more you want to learn from your mistakes and make it better. And so my coding journey continues...!
