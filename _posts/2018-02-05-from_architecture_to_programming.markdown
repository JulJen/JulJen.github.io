When the recession was at its low point in 2010,  I was about to graduate from the University of Cincinnati with a degree in architecture. The building industry was looking pretty grim and it was difficult to land a new grad job. On the bright side, it gave me a chance to explore other fields of work for self-growth before returning to the realm of architecture. After returning to architecture, I worked at design and construction firms based in New York City for a number of years. 

During this time, I questioned whether this was the right path for me. Feeling this stagnancy within myself, I knew I had to face some tough questions. I had to admit to myself that even though I liked architecture, I wasn't really as involved in updating my tech savvy skills since most of the deadline driven projects would mean getting pigeon-holed into doing repetitive tasks and a unpaid overtime. It was enough years in the industry to see that room for growth wasn’t as dynamic as other industries. I needed a change to my schedule that wasn't possible in this industry’s work culture and environment. I craved to be challenged creatively within the support of a community. What else did I want to explore and how did I want to expand my skillset? 
 
My friend had contacted me and told me she was transitioning from teaching to web development. She had told me to check out courses on [treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), and to see what I thought. I tried it out and continued to dabble in various online coding resources like the algorithm platform on [Coding Dojo](http://algorithm.codingdojo.com/). I also attended meetups and even a hackathon in another city (where I spent more time observing and learning alongside others). Even though I tried these different resources, I felt like I was getting fragments of what it meant to program. My friends and mentors that had transitioned into programming jobs from other job sectors encouraged me to stay curious and basically just to keep on doing it. And that is exactly what I did - I stayed involved and utilized the free code resources and tried to meet other people. Michael Hartl's online tutorials -  [Learn Enough to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/) were one of the free online code resources that really made things click in my head. Here I learned how to use a text editor, command line and git. This made it easier to go back and work on the Flatiron school's free pre-bootcamp prep-work.  

This changed my perspective on where I saw my career path going. What I was willing to do was explore and expand my skillset in the programming realm. I applied and was awarded the Women Take Tech Scholarship from Flatiron School, and this made it possible for me to pursue my learning full-time. Learning how to program has become a bit obsessive where the more your code breaks, the more you want to learn from your mistakes and make it better. 

I'll be using this blog to document my thoughts on what I've learned so far on my coding journey. Stay tuned and thanks for reading!
