I graduated from university with a degree in architecture. When the recession was at its low point in 2010, the building industry was looking pretty grim and it was difficult to land a new grad job. On the bright side, it gave me a chance to explore other fields of work for self-growth before returning to the realm of architecture. 

While working at design and construction firms based in New York City for a number of years, I had to admit to myself that even though I liked architecture, I wasn't really as involved in updating my tech savvy skills since most of the deadline driven projects would mean getting pigeon-holed into doing repetitive tasks for a lower salary and unpaid overtime. It was enough years in the industry to see that room for growth wasn’t as dynamic as other industries. I felt like I was building towards a direction that was dishonest. I felt the tug of imposter syndrome. I craved to be challenged creatively within the support of a community. Feeling this stagnancy within myself, I knew I had to face some tough questions. What else did I want to explore and how did I want to expand my skillset? 
 
Over the years, I had dabbled in various online coding resources, attended meetups and even a hackathon in another city (where I spent more time observing and learning alongside others). Michael Hartl's online tutorials -  [Learn Enough to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/) were one of the free online code resources that really made me start learning how to learn, and got me excited. I had also done some of Flatiron school's pre-bootcamp prep-work as well as some other bootcamp preps. This changed my perspective on life again.

What I was willing to do was explore and expand my skillset in the programming realm. I kept coding for free on the weekends and some evenings. I needed a change to my schedule that wasn't possible in this industry’s work culture environment. My friends and mentors that transitioned into programming jobs from other job sectors encouraged me to stay curious and basically just to keep on doing it. And that is exactly what I did - I stayed involved and utilized the free code resources and tried to meet other people. I applied and was awarded the Women Take Tech Scholarship from Flatiron School, and this made it possible for me to pursue my learning full-time. 

Learning how to program has become a bit obsessive where the more it breaks, the more you want to learn from your mistakes and make it better. I'll be using this blog to document my thoughts on what I've learned so far in my coding journey so stay tuned and thanks for reading!
