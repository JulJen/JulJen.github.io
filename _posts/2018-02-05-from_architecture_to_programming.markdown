I graduated from university with a degree in architecture. When the recession was at its low point in 2010, the building industry was looking pretty grim and it was difficult to land a new grad job. On the bright side, it gave me a chance to explore other fields of work for self-growth before returning to the realm of architecture. Then for six years, I practiced architecture at design and construction firms based in New York City. 

Over the years, I had dabbled in various online coding resources, attended meetups and even a hackathon in another city (where I spent more time observing and learning alongside others). Michael Hartl's online tutorials -  [Learn Enough to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/) were one of the free online code resources that really made me start learning how to learn, and got me excited. I had also done some of Flatiron school's pre-bootcamp prep-work as well as some other bootcamp preps. 

Within this time, I met my better half in New York City and had gotten married. We both share a passion for the outdoors and rock climbing.  Each time we traveled, we made friends with locals of that area. These chance encounters gave me the opportunity to learn a little bit about each unique individual and also share a similar passion for climbing and exploring the outdoors. This changed my perspective on life again. After returning from these trips and getting back into the 9-7pm office routine, I felt the tug of imposter syndrome year after year. I never felt particularly excited about what I was doing. After working too many unpaid overtime hours, I craved to be challenged creatively and to not get pigeon-holed doing repetitive tasks without much thinking. 

Feeling this stagnancy within myself, I knew I had to face some tough question. What else did I want to explore and how did I want to expand my skillset? I had to admit to myself that even though I liked architecture, what I really enjoyed were the software programs and using the new APIs. What I was willing to do was explore and expand my skillset in the programming realm. More importantly, my friends and mentors that transitioned into programming jobs from other job sectors encouraged me to stay curious and basically just to keep on doing it. And that is exactly what I did - I stayed involved and utilized the free code resources during evenings and weekends. 

One thing I can stand by is that I feel passionate learning how to learn. Learning how to program has become a bit  obsessive where the more it breaks, the more you want to learn from your mistakes and make it better. And so my coding journey continues...!
