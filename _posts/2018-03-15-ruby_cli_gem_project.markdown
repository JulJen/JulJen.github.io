Woohoo! I am so excited to announce that I've finally finished my first Ruby CLI application at Flatiron School, a gem that scrapes the endangered species list and also gets the latest stories on the [ World Wildlife Fund (WWF)](https://www.worldwildlife.org/) website in an easy to use application!

Please check it out here:
* GitHub repo: https://github.com/JulJen/endangered-species-cli-app
* Video walkthrough: https://youtu.be/HiXm8j38ZB8


Here are some tips that helped me stay on track:

* Write out how you would like your Command Line Interface Controller to interact with the user. I noted everything in a NOTES.md file, which I referred to often for planning my gem out. 

* Stub out interface - get your interface for your CLI model-view controller working without real data and then eventually start scraping. Think about procedural methods and define all things you want your interface to do.

* Find a site that is easy to scrape. Don't make it too hard for yourself - inspect the elements and see if they are scrapable. Start off with individual scrape methods and use CSS selectors to scrape desired information. 

* Get comfortable committing and pushing changes to github more often. I hesitated to commit when my code was all over the place, but I learned a lot from my many mistakes. For example, I was editing my code directly on GitHub in my repository and I had forgotten to git pull --rebase before committing and pushing new changes up to github locally.

* Use all your available  resources - watch and rewatch the Learn video walkthroughs and attend the study groups.

* Schedule a 1:1 with a technical coach if you're having issues. I waited too long on this one when I was struggling with my scraper method.

* If you still don't know -- google and youtube are your friends :)


There are definitely some functions that I would like to add and continue working on, but for now, I'm happy to see the basic features work accordingly. For anyone else out there that's feeling a bit apprehensive about starting this project, be brave and keep pushing forward! Remind yourself that learning is a process not a goal!
