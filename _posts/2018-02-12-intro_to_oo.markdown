> "**Objects can be models and metaphors for the problems we solve in code.**"  - Flatiron School

When I started learning about object orientation in this program, this quote in the lesson sounded very familiar. 

This made me think back to my past experiences in architecture. 

In a Revit drawing document, common building elements (structural columns and beams, windows and doors etc.) are more than just symbolic information about a building. An example would be a door family (or class) that has many door types with instances of doors. Each door is self-aware. Every door type can create saved instances of itself. You can also modify the data for just one instance of a door type or change the type property values for all instances of that door type. 

In design software such as[ AutoCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_Architecture) and  [Revit ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Revit)(an application built for [BIM - Building Information Modeling](https://www.archdaily.com/302490/a-brief-history-of-bim)), both programs use objects to encapsulate data and are the building blocks for design solutions in architecture.

Okay, so those object relationships are WAY more complicated than what I'm doing now! 

But for me, it's a good that I'm starting to see these relationships between "objects" in the software program that I've used in the past. The best way to learn is by experimenting more! Check out my earlier blog ["Reading Errors and learning OO with TDD"](http://juljen.com/reading_errors_and_learning_oo_with_tdd) for part of a video walk-through that I did to understand OO from a TD level.
